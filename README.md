# Mattia Alessandro's Portfolio Website

This website is ment to create an online presence for my work
It contains informations needed from one who's wanting to collaborate with me, offer me a job or simply contact me
to expose me his idea.

## Aims of this website
While developing the website what i wanted to be a goal started to be clear in my mind:

### Generals
The primary aim of this website is to show possible partners that i can make a website that:
1 Is intuitive for the user:
 Who access to my website must know exactly where he is, what he can do there and how.
2 Is Responsive:
 Changing the size of the screen changes some styling rules adapting the content to the screensize, and not loosing
 its good loking design
3 It's simple, yet complete:
 I strongly believe that less is usually better. One page should not be overloaded with elements or information that
 the user doesn't need and confuse the overall look
### First Time Users
1 Get axcess to all information they need, rendered in a elegant and functional way,
2 Learn how to navigate through the pages easily and intuitivelly.
3 Be able to contact me for any kind of Question they have.
### Returning Users
1 Know where to find links to my social networks pages.
2 Know how to download a printable version of my resume.
### Frequent Users
1 Know about any new skill or education accomplshment that i make.
2 Be informed about any new project i run, and have a preview of that.

## Contacts
As you can see running my Website, feedback is really important to me. if you have any note for me, or want to partecipate
to some of my progress you are welcome to contact me either on my email (alessandromattia99@gmail.com) or by the contact me form of my website
(when i'll update it to make it work)

## Deployment 
This project was written with gitpod and ran by github pages.

## Licenses
The Code Institute workspace License has been used on gitpod.

## Technology used
-HTML5
-CSS3
-EXTERNAL CDNs (Bootstrap 4, Googe Fonts, Font Awsome)

## Actual Release and Roadmap
The whole website is written using just Html and Css using only some of the bootsrap 4 JavaScript library, as i'm still studying at the moment.
I Will update the source code frequently as i will be learning new things. When i'll get to JS i will update the contact me form to make it actually work.
I will also have to update the resume section for every new coding language that i learn. You will also notice that the "my-projects" file doesn't really
have any project inside of it; that's because this is my absolute first website, i will add them asap.

## Credits
As said before this website is made using CDNs:
1 Bootstrap has been used for major stiling including some JS features and the grid system.
2 FontAwsome has been used for all icons you can find across the website.
3 Google Fonts has been used to import all fonts used.

All definitions along the website are quoted from Wikipedia.
Special thanks go also to The Code Institute for the git hub template they provided me allowing to limit time losses.

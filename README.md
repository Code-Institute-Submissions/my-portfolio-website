# Mattia Alessandro's Portfolio Website

This website is ment to create an online presence for my work
It contains informations needed from one who's wanting to collaborate with me, offer me a job or simply contact me
to expose me his idea.

## Aims of this website

The primary aim of this website is to show possible partners that i can make a website that:
-Is intuitive for the user:
 Who access to my website must know exactly where he is, what he can do there and how.
-Is Responsive:
 Changing the size of the screen changes some styling rules adapting the content to the screensize, and not loosing
 its good loking design
-It's simple, yet complete:
 I strongly believe that less is usually better. One page should not be overloaded with elements or information that
 the user doesn't need and confuse the overall look
## Contacts
As you can see running my Website, feedback is really important to me. if you have any note for me, or want to partecipate
to some of my progress you are welcome to contact me either on my email (alessandromattia99@gmail.com) or by the contact me form of my website 

## Actual Release and Roadmap
The whole website is written using just Html and Css using only some of the bootsrap 4 JavaScript library, as i'm still studying at the moment.
I Will update the source code frequently as i will be learning new things. When i'll get to JS i will update the contact me form to make it actually work.
I will also have to update the resume section for every new coding language that i learn. You will also notice that the "my-projects" file doesn't really
have any project inside of it; that's because this is my absolute first website, i will add them asap.

## Credits
As said before this website is made using CDNs:
-Bootstrap has been used for major stiling including some JS features and the grid system.
-FontAwsome has been used for all icons you can find across the website.
-Google Fonts has been used to import all fonts used.
Special thanks go also to The Code Institute for the git hub template they provided me allowing to limit time losses.
